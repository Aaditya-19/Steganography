Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

Overview

This project is a steganography-based encryption tool that allows users to hide secret messages inside images securely. Using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter, it provides a simple GUI for users to encrypt and decrypt messages with a passcode. The message is embedded within the image pixels, making it invisible to the naked eye. Only users with the correct password can retrieve the hidden message.

Features

🔒 Secure Message Hiding – Embed secret messages inside images.

🔑 Password Protection – Only authorized users can decrypt the message.

🎨 Simple GUI – Easy-to-use interface with Tkinter.

📷 Image-Based Steganography – No extra storage needed for the message.

🚀 Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

OpenCV – Image processing and pixel manipulation

Tkinter – GUI for user-friendly interactions

OS Module – System operations for opening files

ASCII Encoding – Converts text into numerical values for embedding

Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3+ installed along with the following dependencies:

pip install opencv-python tkinter

How to Run

1. Encrypt a Message into an Image

Place the image (mypic.jpg) in the project directory.

Run the encryption script:

python encrypt.py

Enter the secret message and a passcode.

The encrypted image (encryptedImage.jpg) will be generated.

2. Decrypt a Message from an Image

Run the decryption script:

python decrypt.py

Enter the correct passcode to reveal the hidden message.
